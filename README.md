# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
I wanted to work on this project to make it easier for companies to add and delete items and products that they want to display on any website. This will allow them to easily seed the database with what is avaiable currently, add items and products, search for specific products and categories by their id's, as well as delete items and products. This project taught me to be patient with the routes and to make sure that I carefully check which type of route (.then or async/await) is being asked for, as well as making sure that they connect to the items that they need to connect to.

## Credits
I was aided in making sure my routes were correct by ChatGPT.
